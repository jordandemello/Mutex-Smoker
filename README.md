# Mutex-Smoker
A synchronous simulation involving four people (three smokers and one agent). The act of smoking requires three resources: matches, paper, and tobacco. Each of the three smokers holds one of the three resources. Each cycle, the agent provides two random resources to the smokers. The smoker with the final resource will consume those provided by the agent and will be able to smoke. Source code in smoke.c, can compile using "make smoke".
